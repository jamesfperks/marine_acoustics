Origin of sounds    These are recordings of fin whales, Balaenoptera physalus.    The recordings were made in early 1993 from various locations in    the North Atlantic.  Sounds were digitized by a TEAC DA-P20    digital tape recorder, then filtered with a highpass cutoff of 8    Hz using the matrix-processing package MATLAB.Dates    File names indicate dates of recording.  A file name like    93-001-12 indicates the year (93), day of the year (001), and hour    of the day (12).  The latter is Greenwich time, and the local time    offset is unknown, so the time of day is also unknown.File format    The sounds are stored as .wav files, which are in WAVE format.    The sampling rate, which is encoded in the WAVE header, is 100 Hz.Number of whales    On many of these recordings there are several whales calling.    Different individuals were distinguished by several means.  The    whales here make sequences of regularly repeating calls, so the    timing of successive calls provides strong evidence for    determining which call was made by which whale.  Also, calls of    different whales have different multipath structure and different    loudnesses, so they were distinguished on those grounds as well.Whale call measurement    Call boundaries were detemined using the bioacoustic sound    analysis program Canary.  Spectrograms were made and call start-    and end-time and low- and high-frequency boundaries of each call    were picked by hand.  Time boundaries were adjusted for Canary's    offset of spectrogram frames from the actual times that calls    occur in the time-series waveform.  The spectrogram parameters    used for picking out calls were        Sampling rate       100 Hz        Frame size          64 points  (9.7 Hz filter bandwidth)        Overlap             87.5%      (320 ms spectrogram frame spacing)        FFT size            128 points (0.781 Hz spacing)        Window type         BlackmanWhale call descriptions (annotations)    Whale call descriptions are in the .box files, which are ASCII    tables.  Each sound file has one or more whales, i.e., one or more    .box files associated with it.  Each whale is designated by the    '.a', '.b', etc. part of the .box file name.  Each row of the    table describes one call.  The columns of the table are            start-time  end-time  low-freq  high-freq  SNR  mark-time        where the start- and end-time and low- and high-frequencies define    where and at what frequency the call happens.  SNR is the    signal-to-noise ratio.    The mark time is useful for aligning at a specific point in the    call.  It is Canary's "center time" for the call.  Copyright    MobySound is copyrighted in certain ways; for information, see            http://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/MsCopyright.html.----------------------------------------------------------------------This file is  http://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/MobySound/cetacea/fin-1/README-fin-1.txt
