    Origin of sounds    These are recordings of minke whales, Balaenoptera acutorostrata.    The recordings were made in early 1993 from various locations in    the North Atlantic.  Sounds were digitized by a TEAC DA-P20    digital tape recorder, then filtered with a highpass cutoff of 8    Hz using the matrix-processing package MATLAB.Dates    File names indicate dates of recording.  A file name like    93-001-12 indicates the year (93), day of the year (001), and hour    of the day (12).  The latter is Greenwich time, and the local time    offset is unknown, so the time of day is also unknown.File format    The sounds are stored as .wav files, which are in WAVE format.    The sampling rate, which is encoded in the WAVE header, is 500 Hz.Number of whales    With minke vocalizations, it is often difficult to tell which    whale made a given pulse train.  Decisions about which whale is    calling were made by comparing pulse patterns, frequencies, and    timings.  If two or more successive pulse patterns seemed    identical in these respects, they were labeled as coming from one    whale; otherwise they were labeled as two or more whales.        Because of the difficulty of this process, errors were possible in    both ways -- identifying one whale as two of them, or hearing two    or more whales and believing they were a single whale.  Beware of    the possibility of errors.Identification of species    Identification of these sounds as minke whales is based primarily    on similarity to sounds reported in Winn, H. E., and    P. J. Perkins, "Distribution and sounds of the minke whale, with a    review of mysticete sounds," Cetology 19, 1-12, 1976.    Aircraft overflights to verify the species making these sounds was    also reported during the oral presentation by Capt. Kirk Evans,    USN, at the spring 1994 meeting of the Acoustical Society of    America.  To my knowledge this information has not been published.    (The presentation abstract, which does not mention minkes, is    Evans, K., "The nation's fixed undersea surveillance assets -- a    national resource for the future," J. Acoust. Soc. Am.  95 (no. 5,    pt. 2), 2852S, 1994.)Whale call measurement    Call boundaries were detemined using the bioacoustic sound    analysis program Canary.  Spectrograms were made and call start-    and end-time and low- and high-frequency boundaries of each call    were picked by hand.  Time boundaries were adjusted for Canary's    offset of spectrogram frames from the actual times that calls    occur in the time-series waveform.  The spectrogram parameters    used for picking out calls were        Sampling rate       500 Hz        Frame size          128 points (24.18 Hz filter bandwidth)        Overlap             75%        (64 ms spectrogram frame spacing)        FFT size            256 points (1.953 Hz spacing)        Window type         BlackmanWhale call descriptions (annotations)    Whale call descriptions are in the .box files, which are ASCII    tables.  Each sound file has one or more whales, i.e., one or more    .box files associated with it.  Each whale is designated by the    '.a', '.b', etc. part of the .box file name.  Each row of the    table describes one call.  The columns of the table are            start-time  end-time  low-freq  high-freq  SNR        where the start- and end-time and low- and high-frequencies define    where and at what frequency the call happens.  SNR is the    signal-to-noise ratio.Copyright    MobySound is copyrighted in certain ways; for information, see            http://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/MsCopyright.html.----------------------------------------------------------------------This file is  http://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/MobySound/cetacea/minke-1/README-minke-1.txt
