Origin of sounds        These were made in March 1994 off the north coast of the    island of Kauai, Hawaii.  Sounds were received on custom-built    hydrophones using a Sippican transducer element, transmitted by    Joslyn or L-tronics radio tranceivers (20 kHz bandwidth, with    equalization filtering to even out frequency response), and    digitized and recorded by a TEAC RD-135 digital recorder.    These sounds are from humpback whale song.  Each file is about 15    minutes long, and often songs go on past the end of one file and    finish in the next one.  Also, there may be a few seconds of    overlap between one file and the next, since they were captured    sequentially off tape by stopping the tape, rewinding a bit, and    restarting.  (This was necessary because of the size of the    files.)Dates    File names indicate dates of recording.  A file name like    940305-1037.aif indicates the year (94), month (03), day of the    month (05), and hour and minute (1037).  These times are local    Hawaii time.File format    The sounds are stored as .wav files, which are in WAVE format.    The sampling rate, which is encoded in the WAVE header, is 4000 Hz.Number of whales    On these recordings there is one prominent whale singing.Whale call measurement    Call boundaries were detemined using the bioacoustic sound    analysis program Canary.  Spectrograms were made and call start-    and end-time and low- and high-frequency boundaries of each call    were picked by hand.  Time boundaries were adjusted for Canary's    offset of spectrogram frames from the actual times that calls    occur in the time-series waveform.  The spectrogram parameters    used for picking out calls were        Sampling rate       4000 Hz        Frame size          2048 points  (12.09 Hz filter bandwidth)        Overlap             50%          (116 ms spectrogram frame spacing)        FFT size            2048 points  (1.953 Hz spacing)        Window type         BlackmanWhale call descriptions (annotations)    Whale call descriptions are in the .box files, which are ASCII    tables.  Each sound file has one whale's notes, i.e., one or more    .box files associated with it.  Each row of the table in the .box    file describes one unit of humpback song.  The columns of the    table are            start-time  end-time  low-freq  high-freq  SNR        where the start- and end-time and low- and high-frequencies define    where and at what frequency the call happens.  SNR is the    signal-to-noise ratio.Copyright    MobySound is copyrighted in certain ways; for information, see            http://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/MsCopyright.html.----------------------------------------------------------------------This file ishttp://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/MobySound/cetacea/humpback-1/README-humpback-1.txt
