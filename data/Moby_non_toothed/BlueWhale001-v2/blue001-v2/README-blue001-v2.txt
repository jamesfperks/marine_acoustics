Origin of sounds    These are recordings of blue whales, Balaenoptera musculus.  The    recordings were made in late 1992 and early 1993 from various    locations in the North Atlantic.  Sounds were digitized by a TEAC    DA-P20 digital tape recorder, then filtered with a highpass cutoff    of 8 Hz using the matrix-processing package MATLAB.  There are 486    blue whale calls from 15 whales here.    This sound set is named "blue01-v2".  '01' indicates that this is    the first set of blue whale sounds in MobySound, and 'v2'    indicates that this is the second version of this set.  (The    previous version did not have a 'v1', but it should have.)  This    second version has corrected frequency bounds for many calls, and    corrected SNRs.Dates    File names indicate dates of recording.  Most files have the date    encoded in the file name: A file name like T93012602L indicates    the year (93), month (01), day of month (26), and an index number    for that day (02).  The trailing L is more or less meaningless    here; it indicates that this track was recorded on the left    channel of the tape recorder.  file1.aif and file2.aif were    recorded in mid-December 1992.File format    The sounds are stored as .wav files, which are in WAVE format.    The sampling rate, which is encoded in the WAVE header, is 100 Hz.Number of whales    Some these recordings have more than one whale calling.  Different    whales are distinguished by differences in loudness, multipath    structure, and timing of sequences of calls.  In this case, the    separate whales are annotated with separate .box files, as in    file2.a.box, file2.b.box, and file2.c.box.Whale call measurement    Call boundaries were detemined using the bioacoustic sound    analysis programs Canary and Osprey.  Spectrograms were made and    call start- and end-time and low- and high-frequency boundaries of    each call were picked by hand.  Time boundaries were adjusted for    Canary's offset of spectrogram frames from the actual times that    calls occur in the time-series waveform.  The spectrogram    parameters used for picking out calls were these:        Sampling rate       100 Hz        Frame size          256 points (2.42 Hz filter bandwidth)        Overlap             50%        (1.28 s spectrogram frame spacing)        FFT size            512 points (0.195 Hz spacing)        Window type         Blackman    These parameters are stored in the file 'blue001-v2.opref' in this    directory, which may be loaded into Osprey for making more    annotations.  (Osprey is a free spectrogram/annotation system    written for Matlab; it is found at    http://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/MobySoft.pl .)    Signal-to-noise measurement was done using snr.m, available on the    MobySound web site.Whale call descriptions (annotations)    Whale call descriptions are in the .box files, which are ASCII    tables.  Each sound file has one or more whales, i.e., one or more    .box files associated with it.  Each whale is designated by the    '.a', '.b', etc. part of the .box file name.  Each row of the    table describes one call.  The columns of the table are            start-time  end-time  low-freq  high-freq  SNR        where the start- and end-time and low- and high-frequencies define    where and at what frequency the call happens.  SNR is the    signal-to-noise ratio; see the MobySound file 'snr.m' for more    information.Copyright    MobySound is copyrighted in certain ways; for information, see    MsCopyright.html.Notes on some sound files:    file1.wav and file2.wav have some of the clearest sounds here.        They were recorded in December 1992.      t93011303R.wav and t93012604R.wav have strong multipath effects,        with each whale call arriving at least three times.    At ~2000 seconds into t93011303R.wav, there is a B-only call.
