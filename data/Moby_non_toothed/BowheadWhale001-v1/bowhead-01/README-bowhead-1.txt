Origin of sounds        These were made in April 1988 off the coast of Point Barrow,    Alaska.  Sounds were transduced by homemade hydrophones using    Sippican transducer elements, and transmitted to a TEAC R-61D    cassette data recorder.  The recordings were played back from this    recorder and digitized by a TEAC RD-135T DAT recorder.    These sounds are the end-notes of bowhead whale song; the whole    song is much longer than the snippets recorded here.  Compared to    other parts of the bowhead song, this part of the song is    relatively constant from year to year, but does change somewhat.    It is also relatively loud compared to some other parts of the    song.    Some of these sounds have quite a lot of interfering noise from    bearded seals, ice, banging hydrophone cables, and other sources.Dates    File names indicate dates of recording.  A file name like    B88042003.0307 indicates the year (1988), month (04), day of the    month (20), a tape sequence number that is essentially irrelevant    here (03), and the hour and minute of the day (0307).  The time is    the local time in Barrow.  Sometimes there are two identical    timestamps with 'a' and 'b' suffixes, like B88042615.1229a.aif and    B88042615.1229b.aif.  These are not distinct whales (see below)    but rather are two end-note sequences from the same whale that    occurred less than a minute apart.File format    The sounds are stored as .wav files, which are in WAVE format.    The sampling rate, which is encoded in the WAVE header, is 4000 Hz.Number of whales    On these recordings there is generally one prominent whale    producing sound.  Successive recordings that are near in time are    likely to be from the same whale -- end-notes from successive    songs -- but no guarantee of this is made.Whale call measurement    Call boundaries were detemined using the bioacoustic sound    analysis program Canary.  Spectrograms were made and call start-    and end-time and low- and high-frequency boundaries of each call    were picked by hand.  Time boundaries were adjusted for Canary's    offset of spectrogram frames from the actual times that calls    occur in the time-series waveform.  The spectrogram parameters    used for picking out calls were    Sampling rate       4000 Hz    Frame size          256 points  (96.72 Hz filter bandwidth)    Overlap             50%         (32 ms spectrogram frame spacing)    FFT size            256 points  (15.62 Hz spacing)    Window type         BlackmanWhale call descriptions (annotations)    Whale call descriptions are in the .box files, which are ASCII    tables.  Each sound file has one or more whales, i.e., one or more    .box files associated with it.  Each whale is designated by the    '.a', '.b', etc. part of the .box file name.  Each row of the    table describes one call.  The columns of the table are            start-time  end-time  low-freq  high-freq  SNR  mark-time        where the start- and end-time and low- and high-frequencies define    where and at what frequency the call happens.  SNR is the    signal-to-noise ratio.    The mark time is useful for aligning at a specific point in the    call.  It is Canary's "center time" for the call.  Copyright    MobySound is copyrighted in certain ways; for information, see            http://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/MsCopyright.html.----------------------------------------------------------------------This file is  http://cetus.pmel.noaa.gov/MobySound/cetacea/bowhead-1/README-bowhead-1.txt
